# My Portfolio
## Created by Shay Wagner

### Purpose
I created this portfolio as a place to gather and display my work.  It also serves as an easy way to contact me as it displays my current contact information.
I will continually update this portfolio with more examples.  Below you will find a screenshot as well as links to the deployed application and the GitHub repository.
Thank you for taking the time to view this.
